This is a terminal based local music player for windows written in Rust.
Upon running, it scans the devices storage or in the case, "C:\\Users\\Ernest\\Desktop\\New folder" for testing as it reduces scanning time.
For the liked songs, it saves them to a .txt file that refers to the song's path on the device.
